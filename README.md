# Mopaiv Open Source
All the work I made for Mopaiv. Development originally started in December 2021.

Avatar renderer will be released when I decide if I want to open source it or not.

For support/questions add me on Discord: HUNTER22222#3358.

## What is included?
The following pieces of Mopaiv that I wrote are included:
* ALL the frontend (from the development site https://mopaiv.co, with comments and everything included)
* The item notifier
* The avatar renderer (soon)
